# 3-Key-Ecosystem -- a collection of modular macro-keyboards

This is a collection of macro-keyboards.
Most of them are based on a modular base-board (kbmount).
There are also 2 kinds of single-key boards for custom functions:
one for mechanical keys (the-feely-one),
and one for capacative touch connections (the-touchy-one).
As a bonus, some one-off boards too.
